  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 green bell peppers, halved and seeded</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>water as needed</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>3 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) container cottage cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li> 
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Arrange bell peppers, cut-side up, in a 10x15-inch baking dish; season with salt. Pour enough water into dish to make 1/4-inch depth.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, and black pepper to ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors blend, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fill each bell pepper with a heaping tablespoon cottage cheese; top with a layer of mozzarella cheese, a layer of Cheddar cheese, and meat sauce. Sprinkle each 'boat' with more mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender and cheeses are melted, 50 to 65 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>You can substitute ricotta cheese for cottage cheese <em>if you prefer</em> and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese if you like.</p>
